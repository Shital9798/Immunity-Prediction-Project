# Immunity-Prediction-Project
Developed an immunity prediction system in a team of three, using machine learning models. Predicted human immunity based on factors like protein intake, BMI, and sleeping hours. Focused on frontend development and styling, and integrated it with the backend database using Flask for seamless data retrieval and predictions.

**Academic Major Project**
**Project Title:** Immunity Prediction System

**Team: 3 Members**

Description: Developed an immunity prediction system that leverages machine learning models to predict human immunity based on various factors such as protein intake, BMI, sleeping hours, and more. As a key member of the team, I focused on the frontend development, designing and styling various pages including registration, login, user profile, prediction, and dashboard. Additionally, I integrated the frontend with the backend database using Flask to enable seamless data retrieval and predictions.
